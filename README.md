# icfpc2006-practice
Practicing an old ICFPC task.

## Contest task

Solutions for contest: implementation of a universal machine, auxiliaries and an algorithm for Adventure Game.

## Compiler

Contest task includes [specification](http://boundvariable.org/um-spec.txt) of a UM (universal machine), that is a simplified yet complete machine with Von Neumann architecture. After implementation it runs a provided binary file, that works like a machine code for UM machine, containing a toy operating system. That suggested an out-of-contest task to create a compiler for an arbitrary language to UM code.

The /compiler folder is a project of such compiler for a toy Rust-resembling language.
